You can create a custom string by combining any of these options:
- plain text (example: banana)
- random number from range (example: [0-20] )
- random item from an array (example: [banana~apple~grapes] )

An example of a combined string: $[0-999],[10-99] [new~used~old]

Which would result in "$321,34 old" or "$12,75 new"
